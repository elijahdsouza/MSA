            A simple calculator app that can calculate expression with brackets, using the elementary operations of add, subtract,
             multiply and divide. In addition, a length converter that enables conversions to be done quick and easily.
             This calculator and convertor app can be used by students or people prefer a larger, more elegant display for calculations
             and conversions rather than the default calculator provided or some other length converters online.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through developing this app I have earnt how to implement the Shunting algorithm that evaluates expressions with brackets, 
            and how to control and manage input data from controls. Developing this app has given me how to create basic windows applications
        </p>
        <p>
            I am aware there are still some bugs, with the most apparent one; being that the calculator cant differentiate between negative numbers and 
            incorrect syntax yet. But given more time I would be able to fix them.
